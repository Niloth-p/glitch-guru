## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities either at [Github Issues](https://github.com/Niloth-p/glitch-guru/issues) or at [Glitch Guru itself](https://niloth.pythonanywhere.com/bugs/createBug/)
Reporting vulnerabilities in public is fine because the app does not have any confidential data that needs to be protected at this moment.
